  mode: dynamic # <--- The mode attribute (strict/dynamic/lenient)
  # If mode is set to strict on the other hand, documents containing fields that are not defined in the mapping will be entirely discarded.
  # In lenient mode, the fields that do not appear in the document mapping will simply be ignored.
  # When set to dynamic, all extra fields will actually be mapped using a catch-all configuration.
